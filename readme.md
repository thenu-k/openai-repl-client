### OpenAI REPL Client

To run this client, you need create an OpenAI account and get an API key. 
Rename the .example.credentials.py file to credentials.py and add your API key. Enter your gmail address too.

I didn't create a venv so I wasn't able to add a requirements.txt file. Check out the imports in main.py and install the dependencies manually.

Then, you can run the client with the following command, provided you have node installed:

```npm run start```

Else, you can run the client with the following command, provided you have python3 installed:

```python3 main.py```
